Hello,
the .py program "ImageConverterResizer.py" is here in case you want to load image on your device.
I suggest you take your image in paint, resize it in there to be sure for the current size.
Then drop your image in the ImagePNG folder.
Once you correctly modified somes values in the code according to your image
and start the programs.
Your file will be copied in another file but transformed into another format (and inverted).
Once done, you should copy that .rgb565 file onto your raspberry pico.
Be sure that the file is not too heavy, your pico only has 2mo of storage.
Then, you will be able to use it in your code.

Please just download the ImageMaker folder and launch the program from here.
I let some image in the folder so that you can try.
Thoses images can be found on https://www.pixilart.com/.
I am not the owner of thoses.

Good luck !
