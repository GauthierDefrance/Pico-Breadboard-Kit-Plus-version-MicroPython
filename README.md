***In order to use the code written in .py,***
***you will need to install Micropython on your raspberry***
Tutorial here : https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/microcontrollers/micropython.html

I suggest you also install Thonny : https://thonny.org/

##What give you the code ?
```
My code offer :
- Make easier to use the screen, beeper, joystick and buttons.
- 6 games : Tetris, Snake, Connect Four, Pong, Space Invaders and a Piano.
- A music player that will play some installed songs, you can add your owns.
- Access to the settings : Splash Screen, Leds, Rgb led.
```

The joystick in the kit is really unpleasant, i suggest you to buy another.
I personnally added a PSP2000 Joystick cap on mine.
It works, but don't do it. It won't fit correctly, you will have to make the hole bigger and use glue.

## I used the code of many peoples here is their github
Their codes are pretty nice, don't be scared to check it

https://github.com/antirez/ST77xx-pure-MP : his library allows to controls the ST7796 screen. Was pretty hard to found.
